# Arduino Library for LiquidCrystal displays with I2C PCF8574 adapter

A library for driving LiquidCrystal displays (LCD) by using the I2C bus and an PCF8574 I2C adapter.

There are modules that can be soldered or stacked to the display that offers an I2C interface for communication instead of the 8+ digital lines that are used to send data to the display.

Most of these modules use the wiring that is supported by this library's defaults. If you use a module with a different wiring, you can use one of the class constructors which allow you to specify the bit assignments.

This fork of the library enables arbitrary pin assignments and is about a factor of three faster e.g. for complete screen updates.
